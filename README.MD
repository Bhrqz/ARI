This is the repository of the ARI project. 
ARI stands for App para Registro en Iglesias, in spanish.

The pages for Reports or anomalias are almost complete. The user can create, see and edit the Reports.

I need to do the same for the Visitors.

There will be a change and I will need to create another collection for New User exclusively.
I would need to find a way to pass one document from the new users to the Old users, or Membresia.

Then, I will create a visualizer for the stored data in the Database.

---

At the moment, the Create new Visitor feature is almost done. 
The Edit Visitor feature is almost complete too.
This feature only needs to redirect the user to the actual edition page when tapping the name of a member and update the edited document

The next part is start with the Report creation feature and finish the Edit visitor functionality.

Do not forget to create the roles and privileges for the users
